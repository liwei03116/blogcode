Hi, I'm Eric Li, and this is my blog where I aim to share interesting and worthwhile aspects of my daily life.

I work as a software engineer, focusing on technologies such as C#, .NET, ReactJS, TypeScript, UI libraries, EF framework, and MS SQL Server in my recent years of commercial experience. Despite this focused background, I consider myself an open-minded individual who remains interested in and actively searches for AI projects. My exploration in this realm includes working with computer vision technologies like OpenCV, parallel computing using CUDA, and delving into the vast possibilities of machine learning with TensorFlow.

Beyond my coding endeavors, I am deeply passionate about cars, particularly SUVs, Utes, and caravans. I find joy in exploring 4-wheel drive adventures, embarking on road trips, and engaging in the repair and maintenance of cars. Additionally, I enjoy creating custom accessories for cars, such as the Ute Camper.

Thank you for visiting my blog. I look forward to sharing intriguing and worthwhile aspects of my daily life with you.

best wishes
Eric Li
