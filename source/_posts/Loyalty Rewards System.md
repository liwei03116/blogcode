E-commerce businesses need their clients to have high loyalty to the brand. Two main strategies to enhance client loyalty are point rewards and cash back based on products and services.

## How to Improve Loyalty Rewards in E-Commerce?

Most of the time, you need to contend with the number of points or the amount of money you can give as cash back. Recently, loyalty rewards have also considered reminder systems and machine learning for customer requests. Due to the economic slowdown, many people prefer to focus on rewards from different e-commerce platforms.

## My working System

My working system includes three subsystems or apps: the client portal, merchant portal, and admin portal. The client portal displays and manages client-side information such as member numbers, earned points, and cash back amounts. The merchant portal is controlled by the merchant, who can manage offers, special discounts, promotions, and monitor business metrics such as sales amounts and popular products or services. The admin portal can display and manage everything, including the functions of the client and merchant portals. It can also monitor and register new merchants, and control features and functions.

## Technical stack

The system backend uses C#, .NET, MS SQL Server, ReactJS, Typescript, MUI UI library, Microservices, Azure DevOps, and serverless architecture.
