## Melbourne City Tour

It was a delightful day spent with my family in the city. We visited Melbourne Centre, admired the iconic Melbourne Centre clock, and attended a special event featuring Ernie. We crossed the city road, explored Flinders Station, and marveled at St. Paul's Cathedral and Fed Square.

Later, we returned to the other side of the city road to visit The University of Melbourne. The weather was perfect with clear skies, and we hope that the next time we visit, the sunny day will make an appearance.

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the day.
